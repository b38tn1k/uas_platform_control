so an arm consists of a stepper motor, a servo motor and a button. The stepper motor rotates the physical arm. the servo motor interfaces with the ring, the button exists purely to allow us to calibrate the arm on start-up and run in an open system (zero the stepper motors so I donâ€™t need an encoder)
